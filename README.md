# purescript-webgpu

No-frills bindings to the WebGPU API.

## Goals

1. As close to the [WebGPU spec](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) as possible.
1. Very limited type-level machinery.
1. Clickable docs.
1. Small, single-purpose files.
1. Tests as much of the surface area as possible.

## Non-goals

1. Fancy abstractions.

## For example

[An early test](https://waggish-quartz.surge.sh/).
